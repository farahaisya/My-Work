## Assignment 1 (UTM Digital Open Day)
* The UTMDigital Open Day assignment provided a significant bridge between my academic studies and the realities of the professional IT landscape. By engaging with industry experts, I gained a much deeper understanding of how campus-wide network infrastructures and data strategies are managed in a real-world setting. Beyond the technical exposure to Data Engineering and Agile development, this task helped me develop the ability to synthesize complex information into a professional format. I realized that successful digital transformation relies not only on technical expertise but also on strong collaboration and a commitment to continuous learning. Ultimately, this assignment has refined my professional perspective, leaving me with a clearer vision of industry expectations and the practical skills required to succeed in my future career.

## Assignment 2 (PPG Industry Talk)
* Completing this assignment about the PPG industry talk was a very valuable experience. The assignment helped me understand how the things I learn in class are used in real jobs. I learned that teams like Data Analytics and Global Infrastructure are essential for making smart business decisions. For example, seeing how they use Data Analytics to predict risks in the supply chain made me realize why learning tools like SQL and Python is so important. It was also interesting to learn about SAP systems, which connect all the different parts of a business—like finance and sales—into one single platform. This helped me see how organized and connected a global company must be to succeed. Finally, this project has changed how I think about my future career. I am now more motivated to improve my technical skills, especially in cloud computing and data management. I also learned that soft skills such as being curious and working well with a team, are just as important as technical knowledge. The talk about mentorship and growth at PPG made me feel more confident about entering the professional world. I now feel more prepared to continue my studies, knowing exactly how these skills will help me in the future.

## Assignment 3 (Serunai Industry Talk)
* Through this assignment, I have gained a clear understanding of how the things we learn in class are actually used in the professional world. I learned that building a system is not just about technical skills, it follows a step-by-step process called the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which includes planning, designing, building, and maintaining a system. I now understand that there are two main ways to manage a project, the Waterfall method, which follows a strict plan one step at a time, and the Agile method, where teams work in fast cycles to improve their work based on feedback. This assignment also taught me that for a career in Data Engineering, using these organized methods helps to prevent mistakes and manage large data systems more effectively. Most importantly, I realized that teamwork and good communication are just as important as technical knowledge for a successful career in the future. 

## Assignment 4 (JCorp Industry Visit)
* Working on this newsletter assignment provided a valuable opportunity to explore the inner workings of Johor Corporation (JCorp). By documenting the visit, I gained a much clearer understanding of how enterprise systems and databases function within a major organization. This task allowed me to bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world industrial applications, specifically regarding the integration of computing and networking in a professional environment. The process of designing the three-page newsletter challenged me to develop my technical writing and creative design skills. My group had to organize the company background and technical insights into a layout that was both professional and logically structured. This experience taught me how to present complex information effectively, ensuring that observations on computer-assisted systems were described accurately and clearly. I am grateful to Dr. Aryati, and JCorp for this exposure, which has not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also increased my awareness of industrial standards and practices.

## Design Thinking Project
* Through this design thinking project, we gained a deeper understanding of how to prioritize user needs, learning to think about people’s experiences before focusing on the technology itself. We also strengthened our critical thinking and problem-solving skills by identifying practical solutions for food waste, such as using data from reservations and AI dashboard to help cafeteria staff make more accurate preparation decisions. This design thinking project demonstrated the power of data-driven design and how information from surveys and interviews can lead to logical and effective solutions. Furthermore, we improved our professional collaboration and communication through team meetings and discussions to overcome design flaws. This project has built our confidence in using data and technology to create a positive impact on our community and environment.

## ASEAN Quantum Summit
* Attending presentations by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa and Mr. Ling Keok Tong showed that quantum technology is an important tool for future digital security and economic resilience. The discussions revealed how ideas like superposition and nitrogen fixation applications will greatly change key industries. A key insight from the summit is that staying competitive requires exploring new fields beyond AI alone.
