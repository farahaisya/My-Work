## SECI1013 - Discrete Structure
* This course provided me with the mathematical foundation necessary for computer science. I developed a strong understanding of logic, set theory, and functions. These concepts have improved my ability to think analytically and solve complex problems.

## SECJ1013 - Programming Technique I
* I acquired fundamental programming skills using the C++ language. I learned how to use control structures, functions, and arrays to create efficient programs. I also gained experience in debugging and writing clean, structured code.

## SECR1013 - Digital Logic
*  I gained a clear understanding of the hardware that powers computers. By studying logic gates and circuits, I learned how data is processed at the lowest level. The laboratory sessions were particularly helpful for visualizing these concepts.

## SECP1513 - Technology & Information System
*  This subject introduced me to the broader IT industry. I learned about important trends such as Cloud Computing, 4IR, and Data Analytics. Additionally, the course improved my teamwork and communication skills through group discussions.
