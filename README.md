## SECI1013 - Discrete Structure
* I learned the basic math used in computer science. Before this, I only knew regular math, but now I understand logic, set theory, and graph theory. This course helped me think more clearly and solve problems step-by-step.

## SECJ1013 - Programming Technique I
* This was my first time using C++. I learned how to use variables, loops, and functions to solve problems. I also learned about pointers and arrays, which help manage memory and lists of data.

## SECR1013 - Digital Logic
* This course taught me how computers work on the inside. I learned about logic gates (like AND, OR, NOT) and how hardware processes information. The lab work was very interesting because I could see how circuits work.

## SECP1513 - Technology & Information System
* This course gave me a look at the whole IT world. I learned about cloud computing, networks, and the Internet of Things(IoT). Besides, I also learn how to work better in a team through this course.
