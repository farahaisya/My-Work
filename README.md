## SECI1013 - Discrete Structure
* This course provided me with the mathematical foundation necessary for computer science. I developed a strong understanding of logic, set theory, and functions. These concepts have improved my ability to think analytically and solve complex problems.

## SECJ1013 - Programming Technique I
* I acquired fundamental programming skills using the C++ language. I learned how to use control structures, functions, and arrays to create efficient programs. I also gained experience in debugging and writing clean, structured code.

## SECR1013 - Digital Logic
*  I gained a clear understanding of the hardware that powers computers. By studying logic gates and circuits, I learned how data is processed at the lowest level. The laboratory sessions were particularly helpful for visualizing these concepts.

## SECP1513 - Technology & Information System
*  This subject introduced me to the broader IT industry. I learned about important trends such as Cloud Computing, 4IR, and Data Analytics. Additionally, the course improved my teamwork and communication skills through group discussions.

## REFLECTION OF SEMESTER 1
* In this first semester, I improved my programming skills a lot. I went from being a beginner to a much better coder. Now I understand logic and syntax much better. The course also had many projects and presentations which pushed me to try new things and learn how to work in a team. I also learned how to divide tasks with others and how to explain difficult concepts in simple ways when presenting. Overall, this semester has helped me grow both my software and communication skills.
