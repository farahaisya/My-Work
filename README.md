## SECI1013 - Discrete Structure
* This course provided me with the mathematical foundation necessary for computer science. I developed a strong understanding of logic, set theory, and functions. These concepts have improved my ability to think analytically and solve complex problems.

## SECJ1013 - Programming Technique I
* I acquired fundamental programming skills using the C++ language. I learned how to use control structures, functions, and arrays to create efficient programs. I also gained experience in debugging and writing clean, structured code.

## SECR1013 - Digital Logic
* This course taught me how computers work on the inside. I learned about logic gates (like AND, OR, NOT) and how hardware processes information. The lab work was very interesting because I could see how circuits work.

## SECP1513 - Technology & Information System
* This course gave me a look at the whole IT world. I learned about cloud computing, networks, and the Internet of Things(IoT). Besides, I also learn how to work better in a team through this course.
